# Bored-App

Bored-App is a web application that helps users find fun and interesting activities to do when they're feeling bored. The application uses the Bored API to retrieve a list of random activities and display them to the user.

## Features
The application provides the following features:

Random activities: retrieve a list of random activities from the Bored API and display them to the user.
Share activities: allow users to share activities with their friends via email or social media.

## Authentication
The Bored API does not require authentication to use. However, it does limit the number of requests that can be made in a given time period. To avoid hitting the rate limit, the application caches the results of previous requests and reuses them if they are still valid.
